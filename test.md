Excellent. Let's validate the backend changes made for Phase 32, Subtask 1.

Testing Strategy:

We'll use a tool like curl or a GUI API client (like Postman, Insomnia) to directly send requests to your running backend server (http://localhost:3001). This bypasses the frontend and isolates the backend logic.

Prerequisites:

Backend Server Running: Ensure your node server.js process (with the changes from Subtask 1 implemented) is running.

Valid Auth Token: Log in via the frontend once to get a valid JWT authToken. Copy this token (it's a long string) from the browser's Developer Tools (Application -> Local Storage). You'll need it for the Authorization header.

Known Group ID: Know the ID of a group you are a member of (e.g., "Sample Apartment Bills" from the seed). You can get this from your database directly or potentially from the response of GET /api/groups. Let's assume the ID is GROUP_ID_A.

Known Group ID (Not a Member): If possible, know the ID of a group you are not a member of (this might require manually creating one in the DB or having another user create one). Let's call it GROUP_ID_B. If not possible, we skip that specific test.

Known User ID (Friend): Know the ID of "FriendUser" (FRIEND_USER_ID).

Validation Tests:

(Replace YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN, GROUP_ID_A, GROUP_ID_B, and FRIEND_USER_ID with actual values)

Test 1: GET /api/groups/:groupId (Success)

Request:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" http://localhost:3001/api/groups/GROUP_ID_A


Expected Backend Log: Should show Fetching details for group GROUP_ID_A for user YOUR_USER_ID.

Expected Response Status: 200 OK

Expected Response Body (JSON): Should be a JSON object representing the group ("Sample Apartment Bills"). Crucially, it must contain a members array, and that array should contain objects with user: { id: ..., username: ... } for both you and FriendUser.

{
  "id": "GROUP_ID_A",
  "name": "Sample Apartment Bills",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "updatedAt": "...",
  "members": [
    { "user": { "id": "YOUR_USER_ID", "username": "YOUR_USERNAME" } },
    { "user": { "id": "FRIEND_USER_ID", "username": "FriendUser" } }
    // Order might vary
  ]
}

Test 2: GET /api/groups/:groupId (Not Found / Not Member)

Request: (Use a group ID you are NOT a member of, or an invalid ID)

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" http://localhost:3001/api/groups/GROUP_ID_B
# OR use a clearly invalid ID like '123' if GROUP_ID_B not known
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" http://localhost:3001/api/groups/123

Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Expected Backend Log: Should show attempt Fetching details for group.... May show subsequent errors depending on the case.

Expected Response Status: 404 Not Found

Expected Response Body (JSON): { "message": "Group not found or you are not a member." } (Or potentially "Invalid group ID format." if the ID format was wrong).

Test 3: GET /api/expenses (No Filter - Default)

Request:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" http://localhost:3001/api/expenses
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Expected Backend Log: Fetching ALL expense splits for user ID: YOUR_USER_ID

Expected Response Status: 200 OK

Expected Response Body (JSON): An array containing ALL ExpenseSplit objects assigned to your user ID, including nested expense/group/payer details from all groups.

Test 4: GET /api/expenses (With Group Filter - Success)

Request:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" "http://localhost:3001/api/expenses?groupId=GROUP_ID_A"
# Note: Use quotes around URL if it contains '&' or '?' in shell

Expected Backend Log: Fetching expense splits for user ID: YOUR_USER_ID AND group ID: GROUP_ID_A

Expected Response Status: 200 OK

Expected Response Body (JSON): An array containing ONLY the ExpenseSplit objects assigned to your user ID where the associated expense.groupId matches GROUP_ID_A.

Test 5: GET /api/expenses (With Group Filter - Empty)

Request: (Use a group ID where you have no expenses assigned to you, e.g., a newly created group)

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" "http://localhost:3001/api/expenses?groupId=NEW_GROUP_ID"
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Expected Backend Log: Fetching expense splits for user ID: YOUR_USER_ID AND group ID: NEW_GROUP_ID

Expected Response Status: 200 OK

Expected Response Body (JSON): [] (An empty array).

Test 6: GET /api/balance/detailed (No Filter - Default)

Request:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" http://localhost:3001/api/balance/detailed

Bash

Expected Backend Log: Calculating detailed balances for user ID: YOUR_USER_ID (overall)

Expected Response Status: 200 OK

Expected Response Body (JSON): An array showing the net balance between you and FriendUser across all shared expenses (e.g., [{ userId: 'FRIEND_USER_ID', username: 'FriendUser', balance: 17.75 }]).

Test 7: GET /api/balance/detailed (With Group Filter - Success)

Request:

Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Expected Backend Log: Calculating detailed balances for user ID: YOUR_USER_ID for group GROUP_ID_A

Expected Response Status: 200 OK

Expected Response Body (JSON): An array showing the net balance between you and FriendUser calculated only from expenses within group GROUP_ID_A. (This value should match the overall balance if "Sample Apartment Bills" is the only group you share expenses in).

Test 8: GET /api/balance/detailed (With Group Filter - Not Member)

Request: (Use a group ID you are NOT a member of)

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" "http://localhost:3001/api/balance/detailed?groupId=GROUP_ID_B"

Expected Backend Log: Shows attempt Calculating detailed balances.... May show membership check failure.

Expected Response Status: 403 Forbidden

Expected Response Body (JSON): { "message": "You are not a member of the specified group." }

Execute these tests carefully using your API client or curl. Pay close attention to the Status Code and the structure/content of the JSON response body, comparing it against the expected results. Check the backend logs for confirmation or errors after each request. This will thoroughly validate the backend changes.
